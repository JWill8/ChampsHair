                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Step 1: The Client Consultation</h3>
                <p>Consultations are typically around 1 hour in length. We'll discuss the Sisterlocks hair locking
                    process and your past hair styling
                    habits to best assess the right plan for your hair. </p>
                <p>
                    During this time, you will receive a cluster of sample locks (pictured below) to help determine your
                    natural hair texture and which locking pattern is best suited for you. Sample locks will be in
                    groups of
                    around
                    8-12 </p>
                <p><b>To prep for your consultation, your hair should be:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recently washed</li>
                    <li>Free of any oils or conditioners</li>
                    <li>Without any braids or extensions</li>
                    <li>a minimum of 3 inches long</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are transitioning from chemically processed hair to
                    natural hair, at least 1.5” - 2” of new growth is necessary. <b>note: you do not need to cut off
                        your relaxed hair</b></p>
                <p> If you have recently relaxed your hair or are between braiding appointments,
                    you will need to reschedule the consultation. Additionally, if you are suffering from any scalp
                    conditions that require medical treatment, for health code reasons please reschedule when the
                    condition has improved.</p>

                <p>Once you've had a consultation and are ready to proceed, your initial appointment will be your
                    Sisterlocks establishment</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Thoroughly wash your hair</li>
                    <li>Please do not blow dry or straighten your hair in any way</li>
                    <li>Do not add any conditioners, oils or moisturizers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You will receive a confirmation text message 24 hours prior to your appointment, please
                    confirm by responding to this text</p>
                <p>Please note that these locking sessions can take many hours over the course of several days,
                    please do not plan any other activities on the day of your appointment</p>
                <p><b>After your locking session:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>I'll send you home with shampooing instructions for best results</b> . When washing, be sure to bundle your locks (Braid sections of your hair together, tuck the ends,
                        and
                        secure with a rubber band). Rinsing is very important to avoid product
                        buildup</li>
                    <li><b>Separate your locks from the root after you shampoo.</b> This helps prevent locks from
                        joining together. Be sure to dry hair thoroughly before going to bed.</li>
                    <li><b>Avoid oil based products for the first 6 months.</b> Softening agents found in moisturizers and
                        conditioners can
                        cause your hair to resist the locking process and build-up - especially if the products
                        are not water-soluble</li>
