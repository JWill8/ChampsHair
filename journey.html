                    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Step 1: The Client Consultation</h3>
                    <p>At the Sisterlocks consultation you can expect to spend approximately one hour. The consultation
                        is designed to discuss the Sisterlocks hair locking process. You will be asked questions
                        regarding your lifestyle as it relates to your past and current hair care practices. This
                        includes past hair styling habits, shampooing habits, daily activities such as exercise, outdoor
                        pleasures, etc. We will discuss how the Sisterlocks process differs from other hair locking
                        techniques. Your unique natural hair texture affects the appearance of Sisterlocks. The use of
                        certain types of hair care preparations affects the feel and appearance of Sisterlocks</p>
                    <p>At the consultation, you will receive a cluster of sample locks, in groups of around 8-12. Your
                        should have at least 3” - 4” of hair length. Less than 3” will make the sample locks difficult
                        to analyze. The purpose of these samples is to determine your natural hair texture, any changes
                        in texture and density, and to choose which locking pattern is best suited for your particular
                        hair type. It is strongly recommended that your hair be clean, free of any oils or conditioners
                        and without braids or extensions. If you are transitioning from chemically processed hair to
                        natural hair, at least 1.5” - 2” of new growth is necessary. NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO CUT OFF
                        YOUR RELAXED HAIR. If you have recently relaxed your hair or are between braiding appointments,
                        you will need to reschedule the consultation. If you have an extreme dandruff, eczema or
                        psoriasis condition or an unhealthy scalp, which requires treatment, please reschedule until the
                        condition has improved.</p>
                    <p>In order for Sisterlocks to be uniform in appearance and remain strong and healthy, we must form
                        a partnership. This partnership means agreeing to be consistent with retightening appointments,
                        following post appointment instructions, and using recommended Sisterlocks products exclusively.

                    <p>These helpful tips will make your Sister/Brotherlocks experience go as smoothly as possible</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow the shampooing instructions from you Consultant and in your Starter Kit.  Most importantly, be sure to BUNDLE: Braid sections of your hair together, tuck the ends, and secure with a rubber band PRIOR to shampooing.  Rinsing is very important to avoid product buildup</li>
                        <li>SEPARATE your locks from the root after you shampoo.  This is important to keep locks from joining together.  Dry hair thoroughly before going to bed; this prevents mildew and odor from forming in your locks from being saturated for extended lengths of time.</li>
                        <li>AVOID OIL_BASED PRODUCTS: for at least the first 6 months after getting your locks while you are in a “settling in” phase.  Softening agents found in moisturizers and conditioners can cause your hair to resist the locking process and cause build-up especially if the products are not water-soluble</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">General Maintenance Guidelines</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is important to maintain your locks with regular retightening appointments. Retightening typically ranges from 2 to 4 hours.  I will work with you to develop the ideal retightening interval</li>
                        <li>For health reasons, please come to your retightening appointment with your hair clean.  Please shampoo the day of but no more than 48 hours before your appointment.  If you can’t shampoo before your appointment, please let me know and we'll work to reschedule</li>
                        <li>If you are sick, or recently have been sick, please call to reschedule.  If you come to your appointment exhibiting signs of illness I will kindly ask you to reschedule at that time</li>
                        <li>Sisterlocks&trade; offers an array of products to help keep your locks in top shape.
