                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Step 1: The Client Consultation</h3>
                <p>At the Sisterlocks consultation you can expect to spend approximately one hour. The consultation
                    is designed to discuss the Sisterlocks hair locking process, as well as discussing past hair styling
                    habits, shampooing habits, daily activities such as exercise, outdoor
                    pleasures, etc. Your unique natural hair texture affects the appearance of Sisterlocks. The use of
                    certain types of hair care preparations affects the feel and appearance of Sisterlocks</p>
                <p>At the consultation, you will receive a cluster of sample locks (see picture), in groups of around
                    8-12. Your
                    should have at least 3” - 4” of hair length. Less than 3” will make the sample locks difficult
                    to analyze. The purpose of these samples is to determine your natural hair texture, any changes
                    in texture and density, and to choose which locking pattern is best suited for your particular
                    hair type. It is strongly recommended that your hair be clean, free of any oils or conditioners
                    and without braids or extensions. If you are transitioning from chemically processed hair to
                    natural hair, at least 1.5” - 2” of new growth is necessary. NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO CUT OFF
                    YOUR RELAXED HAIR. If you have recently relaxed your hair or are between braiding appointments,
                    you will need to reschedule the consultation. If you have an extreme dandruff, eczema or
                    psoriasis condition or an unhealthy scalp, which requires treatment, please reschedule until the
                    condition has improved.</p>

                <p>In order for Sisterlocks to be uniform in appearance and remain strong and healthy, we must form
                    a partnership. This partnership means agreeing to be consistent with retightening appointments,
                    following post appointment instructions, and using recommended Sisterlocks products exclusively.

                <p><b>Prior to your locking session:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Come to your appointment with your hair clean</li>
                    <li>Please do not blow dry or straighten your hair in any way</li>
                    <li>Do not add any conditioners, oils or moisturizers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You will recieve a confirmation text message 24-48 hours prior to your appointment, please
                    confirm by responding to this text</p>
                <p>Please note that these locking sessions can take many hours over the course of several days,
                    please do not plan any other activities on the day of your appointment</p>
                <p><b>After your locking session:</b></p>
                <p>These helpful tips will make your Sister/Brotherlocks experience go as smoothly as possible</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow the shampooing instructions from you Consultant and in your Starter Kit. Most
                        importantly, be sure to BUNDLE: Braid sections of your hair together, tuck the ends, and
                        secure with a rubber band PRIOR to shampooing. Rinsing is very important to avoid product
                        buildup</li>
                    <li>SEPARATE your locks from the root after you shampoo. This is important to keep locks from
                        joining together. Dry hair thoroughly before going to bed; this prevents mildew and odor
                        from forming in your locks from being saturated for extended lengths of time.</li>
                    <li>AVOID OIL BASED PRODUCTS: for at least the first 6 months after getting your locks while you
                        are in a “settling in” phase. Softening agents found in moisturizers and conditioners can
                        cause your hair to resist the locking process and cause build-up especially if the products
                        are not water-soluble</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="font-size: 20px;">General Maintenance Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is important to maintain your locks with regular retightening appointments. Retightening
                        typically ranges from 2 to 4 hours. I will work with you to develop the ideal retightening
                        interval</li>
                    <li>For health reasons, please come to your retightening appointment with your hair clean.
                        Please shampoo the day of but no more than 48 hours before your appointment. If you can’t
                        shampoo before your appointment, please let me know and we'll work to reschedule</li>

                        appointment exhibiting signs of illness I will kindly ask you to reschedule at that time
